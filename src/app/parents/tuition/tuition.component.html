                <strong>NOTE:</strong> In order that we can provide the services that your children are entitled to, it is essential that the financial status of the school be stable. The school salaries and overhead expenses cannot be reduced because of "absentee losses" in income. <strong>THEREFORE, THERE IS NO REDUCTION IN TUITION FOR ILLNESS, HOLIDAYS, AND INCLEMENT WEATHER.</strong> Each child is entitled to a one (1) week vacation

                Texas CCS participants are welcome to enroll their child at as we do accept 
                subsidy payments directly from the state. Texas childcare subsidy participants 
                are still responsible for the "balanced billing" portion of tuition each 
                month.
