                    Parents may either call or stop by the facility to see if there is space available for the enrollment of their child/children. If said space is available then parents are more than welcome to take the Parent handbook, enrollment package, and school supply list with them to be filled out and returned whenever the family is ready for the child to start at the Private School.
